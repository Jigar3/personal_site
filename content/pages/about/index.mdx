Hi !!

Jigar Chavada - also known as JC - is currently a student at Indian Institute Of Information Technology, Allahabad and is in his final year of undergraduate study. He has interned at [Gojek](https://www.gojek.io/) as a Product Engineering Intern and previously has also been a Data Engineering Intern at [Atlan](https://atlan.com/). Besides writing code all day and crying about it not working, he likes to read books and browse through Hackernews, Reddit and Twitter.

[Listen Up, Junior](https://anchor.fm/listenup-junior) is a podcast which he hosts together with Ekansh Bansal where they try to learn from alumini of IIIT Allahabad about life after college and the inner workings of the Indian Tech Industry.

He also headed the Events and Management Department at both the Cultural (Effervescence) and Technical (Aparoksha) Festival of IIIT Allahabad, where he coordinated with a team of 50+ hard-working individuals. He was also a member of the Literary Club (Sarasva) of IIIT Allahabad.
