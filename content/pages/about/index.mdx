Hi!!

Jigar Chavada - also known as JC - is currently a student at Indian Institute Of Information Technology, Allahabad and is in his 3rd year of undergraduate study. He is a software developer with two industrial internships under his belt. One at [Gojek](https://www.gojek.io/) and the other at [Atlan](https://atlan.com/). Besides writing code all day and crying about it not working, he likes to read books and browse through Reddit and Twitter.

He also headed the Events and Management Department at both the Cultural (Effervescence) and Technical (Aparoksha) Festival of IIIT Allahabad, where he coordinated with a team of 50+ hard-working individuals. He was also a member of the Literary Club (Sarasva) of IIIT Allahabad.
